Pyspatialml is a Python module for applying scikit-learn machine learning
models to raster datasets. Pyspatialml includes functions and classes for
working with multiple raster datasets and performing a typical machine
learning workflow consisting of extracting training data and applying the
predict or predict_proba methods of scikit-learn estimators to a stack of
raster datasets. Pyspatialml is built upon the ``rasterio`` Python module
for all of the heavy lifting.  Pyspatialml is also designed for working with
vector data using the ``geopandas`` module.

Background
==========

A supervised machine-learning workflow as applied to spatial raster data
involves several steps:

1. Extracting training data.

2. Developing a machine learning classifier or regressor model. Pyspatialml
uses scikit-learn for this purpose.

3. Performing the prediction on the raster data.

Training data consists of two components - a response feature and a set of
predictors. With spatial data, the response feature is often represented by a
locations when some property/state/concentration is already established. This
data can be represented by point locations (e.g. arsenic concentrations soil
samples), pixel locations where the pixel value represents the target of
interest, or polygon features (e.g. labelled with landcover type). The
predictors are represented by raster data, which contain variables that that
in part may explaining the spatial distribution of the response variable
(e.g., raster data representing soil types, soil properties, climatic data
etc.).
